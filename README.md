# NETWORK-ENDURANCE-FOR-DDOS-ATTACK
A  machine learning based prediction for DDOS ATTACK
## Overview
Distributed network attacks are referred to, usually, as Distributed Denial of Service
(DDOS) attacks. These attacks take advantage of specific limitations that apply to any
arrangement asset, such as the framework of the authorized organization's website. A
DDOS attack sends different requests (with IP spoong) to the target web assets to exceed
the site's ability to handle various requests, at a given time, and make the site unable to
operate effectively and efficiently _ even for the legitimate users of the network.
## Steps
### Data Preparation and Exploration:
Loading and inspecting the dataset, handling missing values, exploring the
data through visualizations.
### Feature Engineering:
Transforming and encoding features, scaling data, and spliƫng it into training and test
sets.
### Model Training and Evaluation:
Training various machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and
fine-tuning hyperparameters.
### Deep Learning with Hyperparameter Tuning:
Building and tuning a deep neural network using Keras Tuner. 
### Model Evaluation and Visualization:
EvaluaƟng models using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion
matrices.
